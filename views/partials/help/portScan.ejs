This monitor checks if any system ports on a host are open when they should not be.  System ports are ports in the range of 0 to 1023.  Having any of these ports open unknowingly provides
hackers a potential way to compromise your devices.
<br><br>
The reason locking down system ports is so important is because these ports require superuser privileges on Unix/Linux systems and expose the device to hacks beyond the service running.
<br><br>
This test is performed once per day.

This monitor checks if your domain has been blocklisted, using the most reputable blocklists.  This can occur if a certain threshold
of complaints are received by the listing services.  Website domains can be blocklisted by appearing on emails that are considered spam.
<br><br>
However, you do not actually need to be engaged in spam to get listed.  Domains are listed based on algorithms that can trap non-spammers unknowingly.
<br><br>
The effect of being blocklisted is that most of your emails will no longer be delivered.

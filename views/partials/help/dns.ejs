The DNS monitor uses our global network of monitoring stations to make sure your DNS values have not changed.  You can set up specific checks at specific stations in the case of regional differences
in DNS record values.
<br><br>
The DNS monitor supports checking all common DNS record types.  You add a record type and expected value, and if that changes you will alerted.  This protects against malicious or accidental changes.
<br><br>
You can populate the expected values with your existing DNS values by clicking on the 'Get Existing Values' button.

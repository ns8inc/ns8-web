This monitor checks if your email server's I.P. address has been blocklisted, using the most reputable blocklists.  This can occur if your email server
is misconfigured (as an open relay), compromised or is sending spam.
<br><br>
Like domain blocklists, you do not actually need to be engaged in spam to get listed.  Email servers can be blocklisted due to hacks, or in some cases, because the server's I.P.
address is close to a spam sending email server's I.P. address.
<br><br>
The effect of being blocklisted is that most of the email transmitted by your server will not be delivered.  Generally, the emails are simply dumped - not routed or delivered.

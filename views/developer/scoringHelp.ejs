                    <h1>Realtime User Scoring/Profiling</h1>
                    <br>The <%- application.branding.productName %> user profiling and scoring API provides the ability to get real-time intel on your users from any platform you are using. It uses a
                    standard REST interface that returns a JSON object with the profile data. It can be integrated into any major platform.

                    <br /><br /><h3>Example:</h3>
                    One of the simplest ways to access the API is with an HTTPS call.  Click on the link below for an example using our free version:
                    <br /><pre>
<a target="sample" href="https://api.ns8.com/v1/score?ip=72.211.250.156&ua=Mozilla%2F5.0%20(Windows%20NT%206.1%3B%20WOW64)%20AppleWebKit%2F537.36%20(KHTML%2C%20like%20Gecko)%20Chrome%2F42.0.2311.135%20Safari%2F537.36&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmysite.com%2Fsearch%3Futm_campaign%3DBingAds&referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fbing.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dbicycles">https://api.ns8.com/v1/profile?ip=72.211.250.156&ua=Mozilla%2F5.0%20(Windows%20NT%206.1%3B%20WOW64)%20AppleWebKit%2F537.36%20(KHTML%2C%20like%20Gecko)%20Chrome%2F42.0.2311.135%20Safari%2F537.36&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmysite.com%2Fsearch%3Futm_campaign%3DBingAds&referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fbing.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dbicycles</a>
</pre>
                    <br />This returns a JSON object with the user's score and profile.  An example with comments:
                    <br /><pre>
{
    "code": 200,                            //  the HTTP status code of the call - 200 means the call was successfully processed
    "data": {
        "score": 520,                       //  a score less than 100 indicates a very high likelyhood of a bot or an invalid user
        "offense": null,                    //  this identifies the primary reason a user has a low score (colocation, collusion, etc.)
        "organization": "Acme, Inc.",       //  the company, ISP, school or governmental agency of the user

                    <br><h3>Error Codes</h3>
                    Any code returned other than 200 indicates an error.  The "message" property will describe the error.  For example:
                    <br /><pre>
{
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Missing parameter(s): I.P. address"
}</pre>
                    <br><h2>Implementation Examples</h2>
                    All major platforms support REST interfaces.  Here are a few examples on platform-specific implementations:
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="/developer/scoring/node">Node.js</a></li>
                        <li><a href="/developer/scoring/dotnet">.NET</a></li>
                        <li><a href="/developer/scoring/https">HTTPS</a></li>
                        <li><a href="/developer/scoring/curl">CURL</a></li>
                    </ul>

                    <br><h2>Colocation</h2>
                    The scoring API is engineered to be extremely fast, returning data in under 5 milliseconds.  However, internet latency will add to that time.  Therefore, our
                    API can be co-located at the datacenter your servers reside at, which will allow for near real-time access to user information.  Please contact us for
                    more information.
